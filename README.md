AddressBookRuby
===============
Make an address book for users to store contact information about people they know. You'll start with a very basic application and then add several layers of functionality.

Here's what you should build, in order:

Add contacts with just a name, phone number, email, and mailing address.
List out the contacts' names.
Choose a contact to view all of the information about it.
Add multiple phones, emails, and addresses to each contact. Hint: make classes for Phone, Email, and Address.
Allow contacts to be edited.
Let contacts be deleted.
Phone, Email, and Address are pretty similar, huh? Read about inheritance and refactor your code accordingly.
